            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <div>
                <!-- Player Needed? -->
                <br>
                <h4>How many player(s) are needed?</h4>
                <p>The game is played by 7 players. The game can’t be started if there are less than 7 players.</p>
                 
                <!-- Game Objective? -->
                <br>
                <h4>What is the object of the game?</h4>
                <p>As soon as 1 Great Power controls 18 supply centers, it’s considered to have gained control of Europe. The player representing that Great Power is the winner. However, players can end the game by agreement before a winner is determined. In this case, all players who still have pieces on the game board share equally in a draw.</p>
                
                <!-- Playable Countries? -->
                <br>
                <h4>What are the playable countries?</h4>
                <p>One of 7 “Great Powers of Europe” in the years prior to World War I. These include England, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Italy, France, and Austria-Hungary (referred to as Austria).</p>
                
                <!-- Units and Movement? -->
                <br>
                <h4>What are the playable countries?</h4>
                <p>Units are supply centers designated for each player (countries) at the beginning of the game. Three supply centers are given for each country, except Russia, which is designated with 4 supply centers. To move the unit, the player clicks on adjacent provinces and make the “move” order. If the order is successful, for example, “A Paris-Burgundy” which represent an order to move from Paris to Burgundy will be displayed on the player’s unit list.</p>
                
                <!-- Get More Troops? -->
                <br>
                <h4>How do I get more troops?</h4>
                <p>During winter, players may create new units on their starting supply centers if certain conditions are met. The player must own more supply centers than units, and the number of units they create cannot bring the total amount greater than the number of centers. A starting supply center must also be unoccupied to build a unit on it. Army units may be created at any supply center, and fleet units at any coastal supply center.</p>

                <h4>How do I win the game?</h4>
